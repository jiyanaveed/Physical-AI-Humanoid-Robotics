# Data Model: Module 4 - Control Systems and Robot Dynamics

## Conceptual Entities

This module primarily deals with conceptual entities inherent to control systems and robot dynamics, rather than persistent data storage entities or API models. The "data model" here refers to the structure and relationships of key variables and information that are manipulated by the control algorithms and kinematic/dynamic models.

### 1. Robot State

**Description**: Represents the current configuration and motion characteristics of a robot or its components (e.g., a single joint, an end-effector, or the entire robot base).
**Fields**:
*   `position`: Current position (e.g., joint angle, Cartesian coordinates [x, y, z]).
*   `orientation`: Current orientation (e.g., quaternion, rotation matrix, Euler angles).
*   `velocity`: Linear and/or angular velocity (e.g., joint angular velocity, Cartesian linear/angular velocity).
*   `acceleration`: Linear and/or angular acceleration (e.g., joint angular acceleration, Cartesian linear/angular acceleration).
*   `time_stamp`: Time at which the state was recorded.
**Relationships**: Updated by sensor readings, used by controllers, output by kinematic/dynamic models.

### 2. Sensor Readings

**Description**: Raw or processed data from various robot sensors that provide information about the robot's state or environment.
**Fields**:
*   `type`: Type of sensor (e.g., IMU, encoder, camera, LiDAR).
*   `value`: The measurement itself (e.g., angular velocity, joint position, image data, point cloud data).
*   `noise_characteristics`: Statistical properties of sensor noise (conceptual, for simulation/modeling).
*   `time_stamp`: Time at which the reading was taken.
**Relationships**: Provides input to state estimation, kinematics, and control algorithms.

### 3. Control Commands

**Description**: Desired inputs to the robot's actuators to achieve a target state or trajectory.
**Fields**:
*   `type`: Type of command (e.g., joint torque, joint velocity, joint position, end-effector wrench).
*   `value`: The command value.
*   `gains`: Controller gains (e.g., P, I, D for PID controllers).
*   `time_stamp`: Time at which the command was issued.
**Relationships**: Generated by control algorithms, sent to robot actuators (simulated or real).

### 4. Trajectory

**Description**: A sequence of desired robot states over time, defining a path and timing for robot motion.
**Fields**:
*   `points`: A list of `Robot State` entities (or simplified versions) at discrete time intervals.
*   `duration`: Total time for the trajectory.
*   `interpolation_method`: Method used to generate intermediate points (e.g., cubic spline, quintic polynomial).
**Relationships**: Generated by trajectory planners, followed by control algorithms.

### 5. Robot Model Parameters

**Description**: Geometric, inertial, and dynamic properties of the robot used in kinematic and dynamic calculations.
**Fields**:
*   `link_lengths`: Lengths of robot links.
*   `joint_limits`: Range of motion for each joint.
*   `masses`: Mass of each link.
*   `inertias`: Inertial properties of each link.
*   `DH_parameters`: Denavit-Hartenberg parameters for kinematic chains.
**Relationships**: Static parameters used by kinematic and dynamic functions.

## No Traditional API Contracts or Database Models

Given the educational and code example focus of Module 4, there are no traditional API contracts (e.g., REST/GraphQL schemas) or database models required. The "interactions" are primarily through function calls within Python code, where these conceptual entities are represented as Python classes, data structures (e.g., NumPy arrays), or ROS 2 messages.
