# Research: Best Analogies for ROS 2 Concepts

This document compiles effective analogies for explaining core ROS 2 concepts to beginners.

## Nodes
- **Analogy**: A team of specialists in a workshop. Each specialist (node) has a specific job (e.g., a welder, a painter). They work independently but communicate to get a larger project done.

## Topics
- **Analogy**: A public announcement system or a radio station. A node (announcer) publishes messages (announcements) on a specific channel (topic). Any other node (listener) can tune into that channel to receive the messages. It's a one-to-many communication.

## Services
- **Analogy**: A direct phone call or a query to a database. One node (caller) makes a specific request to another node (service provider) and waits for a direct response. It's a one-to-one, request-reply communication.
