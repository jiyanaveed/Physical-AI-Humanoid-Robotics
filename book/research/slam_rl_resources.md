# Key Resources for SLAM and Reinforcement Learning

This document compiles a list of high-quality resources for learning the theory behind Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and Reinforcement Learning (RL).

## SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)

### Books

1.  **"Probabilistic Robotics" by Sebastian Thrun, Wolfram Burgard, and Dieter Fox**: The foundational textbook on robotics, with several chapters dedicated to SLAM.
2.  **"State Estimation for Robotics" by Timothy D. Barfoot**: A more modern and in-depth mathematical treatment of the state estimation problems at the core of SLAM.

### Online Courses & Lectures

1.  **Cyrill Stachniss's SLAM Course (University of Freiburg)**: A comprehensive university course with video lectures and slides available on YouTube. Covers everything from fundamentals to advanced topics.

### Papers

1.  **"Past, Present, and Future of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping: Toward the Robust-Perception Age" (Cesar Cadena et al., 2016)**: A great survey paper that provides a historical overview and discusses the major components of modern SLAM systems.
2.  **"ORB-SLAM2: an Open-Source SLAM System for Monocular, Stereo and RGB-D Cameras" (Raúl Mur-Artal et al., 2017)**: The paper for one of the most famous and widely used open-source SLAM systems.

## Reinforcement Learning (RL)

### Books

1.  **"Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto**: The definitive textbook for RL, covering the topic from the ground up.

### Papers

1.  **"Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning" (Volodymyr Mnih et al., 2013)**: The seminal paper that introduced the Deep Q-Network (DQN) and kicked off the deep RL revolution.
2.  **"Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms" (John Schulman et al., 2017)**: Introduces the PPO algorithm, which has become a standard and widely used RL algorithm.
